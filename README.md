## Why I Built This
This site was built as a school project for art students. In countries like mine art is almost never taught right. 
Most teachers find a book that covers the paintings that the government curriculum mentions and reads it to us write.
So many understand nothing about the painting nor have we ever seen them. 
Of course you could google now but back then it was not an option for many and most of the content are hard to understand alone even now.
Plus in schools because of the limited time period there is no interaction between the students and teacher to discuss about art.
So I built this web site as pilot project for teachers and students to discuss about paintings.

The site was built using vanilla PHP, Javascript ans CSS (plus a little bootsrap 4). Thought to upload it to github to help anyone who wants to build components simillar to this.

## Note:
**For development server MAMP Pro was used to create a custom url `http://dev.artcritiq.com` so it doesn't show `http://localhost:_port`**

The website has its own admin dashboard for teachers to enroll students to causes, to create topics to discuss, to vote students opinions, to add his/her own opinion a and to award opinions(like in reddit).
When a student is enrolled to a course they can go to topics and view the painting and discuss matters under the topic. The student can also vote for other opinions on the topic brought up by other students.
This can be useful for the teacher to get a basic idea about her students and for the students to interact and understand different opinions.
